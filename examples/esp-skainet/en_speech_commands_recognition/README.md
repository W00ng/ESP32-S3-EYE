# English Speech Commands Recognition



(See the [README.md](../README.md) file in the upper level 'examples' directory for more information about examples.)



In this example, we have configured 32 command IDs to represent:
```
0,tell me a joke  
1,sing a song  
2,play news channel  
3,turn on my soundbox  
4,turn off my soundbox  
5,highest volume
6,lowest volume
7,increase the volume
8,decrese the volume
9,turn on the tv
10,turn off the tv
11,make me a tea
12,make me a coffee
13,turn on the light
14,turn off the light
15,change the color to red
16,change the color to green
17,turn on all the lights
18,turn off all the lights
19,turn on the air conditioner
20,turn off the air conditioner
21,set the temperature to sixteen degrees
22,set the temperature to seventeen degrees
23,set the temperature to eighteen degrees
24,set the temperature to nineteen degrees
25,set the temperature to twenty degrees
26,set the temperature to twenty one degrees
27,set the temperature to twenty two degrees
28,set the temperature to twenty three degrees
29,set the temperature to twenty four degrees
30,set the temperature to twenty five degrees
31,set the temperature to twenty six degrees
```


## How to use this example


### Additional Hardware Required

\- A Speaker

### Configure, Build and Flash


##### set-target 

```
idf.py set-target esp32s3
```

##### configure

Select the default sdkconfig according to the development board module

For example:  

```
cp sdkconfig.defaults.esp32s3 sdkconfig
```

##### build&flash

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run the monitor tool to view the output via serial port:

```
idf.py -b 2000000 flash monitor 
```

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

### Modify speech commands

For English MultiNet, we use international phonetic alphabet as unit. [multinet_g2p.py](https://github.com/espressif/esp-sr/blob/release/v1.0/tool/multinet_g2p.py) is used to convert English phrase into phonemes which can be recognized by multinet．　
Now, the MultiNet support two methods to modify speech commands.　

#### 1.menuconfig (before compilation)

Users can define their own speech commands by `idf.py menuconfig -> ESP Speech Recognition -> add speech commands` 

#### 2.reset API (on the fly)

Users also can modify speech commands on the fly.

```
// English
char *en_commands_en = "TfL Mm c qbK;Sgl c Sel;TkN nN jc LiT;TkN eF jc LiT";
multinet->reset(model_data, en_commands_en, err_id);
```

**Note:**

- One speech commands ID can correspond to multiple speech command phrases;
- Up to 200 speech commands ID or speech command phrases, including customized commands, are supported;
- Different Command IDs need to be separated by ';'. The corresponding multiple phrases for one Command ID need to be separated by ','. 
- `err_id` return the spelling that does not meet the requirements.  


##### check the version of models

To ensure that the example is configured correctly, please check the version of wakenet, multinet and AFE
