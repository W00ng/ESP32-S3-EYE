## 1.7. Default Firmware and Function Test

Each ESP32-S3-EYE board comes with pre-built [default firmware](https://github.com/espressif/esp-who/tree/master/default_bin/esp32-s3-eye) that allows you to test its functions including voice wake-up, voice command recognition, face detection and recognition.

To test the board's functions, you need the following hardware:

-   1 x ESP32-S3-EYE
-   1 x USB 2.0 cable (Standard-A to Micro-B), for USB power supply

Before powering up your board, please make sure that it is in good condition with no obvious signs of damage. Both the main board and the sub board should be firmly connected together. Then, follow the instructions described below:

1. Connect the board to a power supply through the **USB Port** using a USB cable. While the board is powered up, you will notice the following responses:

* The **Module Power LED** turns on for a few seconds, indicating that the default firmware is being loaded. 
* The **Module Power LED** turns off, indicating the default firmware has been loaded. The board enters human face recognition mode by default. 
* The LCD display shows live video streaming.

At this point, the board is ready for further instructions. You can control the board with either function buttons or voice commands. Function button control is described first:

2. Face the camera so whole human face is visible on the screen for the board to detect. Once a human face is detected, the board displays a blue rectangle.
3. Press **MENU** so that the board enters an ID (starting from 1) for a detected human face.
4. Press **UP+** so that the board starts face recognition. Once a face is recognized, the board displays the entered face ID. If it doesn’t know the face, it displays “WHO?”.
5. Press **PLAY** to delete the latest face ID. The board displays "XXX ID(S) LEFT".

To control the board with voice commands, follow the instructions below:

1. Complete step 1 described previously and notice responses from the board.
2. Activate the board with the default English wake word “Hi ESP”. When the wake word is detected, the **Module Power LED** will turn on, indicating that the board is ready for a speech command.
3. Say an English speech command to control the board. Once a speech command is recognized, the **Module Power LED** will blink. The supported English speech commands in face recognition mode are listed below:

| Default English Speech Commands | Response |
|---------------------------------|----------|
| Enter face       | The board enters a human face ID. |
| Recognize face   | The board displays a recognized human face ID, or "WHO?" for an unrecognized face. |  
| Delete face      | The board deletes the latest human face ID entered and displays "XXX ID(S) LEFT". |

4. After waking up the board as described in step 2, you can also switch the board's working mode with speech commands. Once a speech command is recognized, the **Module Power LED** will blink.

| Speech Commands for Different Working Modes | Response |
|---------------------------------|----------|
| Face recognition    | The board displays a blue rectangle if a human face is detected. |  
| Motion detection    | The board displays a solid blue rectangle in upper-left corner if motion is detected. |
| Display only        | The board displays only live video streaming. |
| Stop working        | The board does nothing and displays Espressif logo. |

# 4. Hardware Revision Details

## 4.1. Revision History

Compared to ESP32-S3-EYE v2.1, ESP32-S3-EYE v2.2 has two changes in hardware: 1) marking on the main board，2) additional current limiting resistor on the main board; and one change in firmware: additional support for English wake-up word and commands.

Changes in hardware are described in detail below:

1.  Marking on the (back of) main board: ESP32-S3-EYE v2.2 has marking "ESP32-S3-EYE-MB_V2.2" on the main board, while ESP32-S3-EYE v2.1 has marking "ESP32-S3-EYE-MB_V2.1" on the main board.

| ESP32-S3-EYE-MB_V2.2 Marking      | ESP32-S3-EYE-MB_V2.1 Marking |
|--------------------|----|
|  ![ESP32-S3-EYE-MB_V2.2 Marking](../../_static/get-started/esp32-s3-eye-v2_2-marking.png) |![ESP32-S3-EYE-MB_V2.1 Marking](../../_static/get-started/esp32-s3-eye-v2_1-marking.png) |

2.  The current limiting resistor R83 is added to the ESP32-S3-EYE v2.2 main board to protect the **Module Power LED** from burning in case GPIO3 is pulled up.

| ESP32-S3-EYE v2.2 with R83     | ESP32-S3-EYE v2.1 Without R83  |
|--------------------|----|
|  ![ESP32-S3-EYE v2.2 with R83](../../_static/get-started/esp32-s3-eye-v2_2-resistor.png) |![ESP32-S3-EYE v2.1 Without R83](../../_static/get-started/esp32-s3-eye-v2_1-resistor.png) |

3.  The **main board schematics**, **main board PCB layout diagrams**, **main board dimension diagrams**, **main board dimension source files** are updated because of the two hardware changes. (See [Related Documents](#5-related-documents)).

## 4.2. known Issues

ESP32-S3-EYE does not have a USB-to-UART bridge, which may cause a problem: If the program flashed onto the board keeps the chip rebooting, you cannot flash more programs onto the board.

In case this issue occurs, you need to:

- Hold down BOOT button and press RST button, then release RST button first, and BOOT button next. In this way, the board enters Firmware Download mode and you can start flashing program onto the board.
- After flashing the program, press RST button to start the program.
